# Quick Setup Guide

This guide will help you get the Roo Code Memory Bank MCP Server running in just a few minutes.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Recommended)

### Step 1: Configure Your MCP Client (No Installation Required!)

Simply add the server configuration to your MCP client - the package will be automatically downloaded and run via npx/bunx.

#### For Cline (VS Code Extension)

1.  Open VS Code
2.  Go to Settings ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Cline
3.  Find "MCP Server Settings" or open your `cline_mcp_settings.json`
4.  Add this configuration:

**Using npx (recommended for npm users):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roo-memorybank-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["roo-memorybank-mcp"],
      "env": {},
      "transportType": "stdio",
      "autoApprove": [
        "initialize_memory_bank",
        "check_memory_bank_status",
        "read_memory_bank_file",
        "append_memory_bank_entry"
      ],
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60
    }
  }
}
```

**Using bunx (recommended for bun users):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roo-memorybank-mcp": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["roo-memorybank-mcp"],
      "env": {},
      "transportType": "stdio",
      "autoApprove": [
        "initialize_memory_bank",
        "check_memory_bank_status",
        "read_memory_bank_file",
        "append_memory_bank_entry"
      ],
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Claude Desktop

1.  Open Claude Desktop settings
2.  Navigate to MCP servers configuration
3.  Add the same configuration as above (choose npx or bunx based on your preference)

### Step 2: Test the Installation

1.  Restart your MCP client (Cline/Claude Desktop)
2.  In a chat, ask your AI assistant to:
    ```
    Check the memory bank status and initialize it if needed
    ```
3.  The assistant should use the MCP tools and create a `db/memory-bank.db` file.
4.  The package will be automatically downloaded on first use.

## üîß Alternative: Global Installation

If you prefer to install globally first:

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js 18+ installed
-   NPM or Bun package manager

### Install Globally

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g roo-mcp-server

# Using bun
bun install -g roo-mcp-server
```

### Configure with Direct Command

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roo-memorybank-mcp": {
      "command": "roo-memorybank-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {},
      "transportType": "stdio",
      "autoApprove": [
        "initialize_memory_bank",
        "check_memory_bank_status",
        "read_memory_bank_file",
        "append_memory_bank_entry"
      ],
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60
    }
  }
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Project Integration

### For New Projects

1.  Navigate to your project directory
2.  Ask your AI assistant to initialize the memory bank:
    ```
    Initialize the memory bank for this project
    ```
3.  The assistant will create a `db/memory-bank.db` file and populate the initial documents.

### For Existing Projects

1.  Have your project brief or documentation ready
2.  Ask your AI assistant:
    ```
    Initialize the memory bank and include this project information: [paste your project description]
    ```

## üìÅ Understanding the Memory Bank Structure

After initialization, the server will create a `db/` directory in your project:

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ memory-bank.db      # SQLite database for all context
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (your project files)
```
All context, including documents like `productContext.md` and `decisionLog.md`, is stored inside the `memory-bank.db` file.

## üîç Verification Checklist

-   [ ] MCP client configuration updated with npx/bunx command
-   [ ] MCP client restarted
-   [ ] Memory bank tools working in chat
-   [ ] Package automatically downloaded on first use
-   [ ] `db/memory-bank.db` file created on initialization

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue: "npx: command not found"
**Solution**: Ensure Node.js and npm are properly installed
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

### Issue: "bunx: command not found"
**Solution**: Ensure Bun is properly installed
```bash
bun --version
```

### Issue: Package download fails
**Solution**:
1.  Check internet connection
2.  Try with global installation instead
3.  Verify npm/bun registry access

### Issue: MCP client can't find the server
**Solution**:
1.  Verify the command path in your configuration
2.  Check MCP client logs for error details
3.  Try restarting the MCP client

### Issue: Tools not appearing in AI assistant
**Solution**:
1.  Restart your MCP client completely
2.  Check the `disabled: false` setting
3.  Verify the configuration syntax is valid JSON

## üìû Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1.  **Check the logs**: Most MCP clients show logs in their developer tools
2.  **Test manually**: Run `npx roo-mcp-server` or `bunx roo-mcp-server` in terminal to check for errors
3.  **Verify package**: Check that the package exists at [npmjs.com/package/roo-mcp-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roo-mcp-server)
4.  **Open an issue**: [Report bugs here](https://github.com/IncomeStreamSurfer/roo-memorybank-mcp-server/issues)

## üéØ Next Steps

Once everything is working:

1.  **Explore the tools**: Try each MCP tool to understand their capabilities
2.  **Customize your workflow**: Integrate memory bank usage into your development process
3.  **Read the docs**: Check out the [full documentation](../README.md) for advanced usage

## üí° Pro Tips

-   **Auto-approval**: The `autoApprove` setting lets tools run without confirmation
-   **Timeout**: Increase timeout for large projects or slow systems
-   **Multiple projects**: Each project directory gets its own `db/memory-bank.db`
-   **Backup**: Consider backing up your `db/memory-bank.db` file regularly
-   **Package caching**: npx/bunx will cache the package after first download for faster subsequent runs

**Happy coding with persistent context! üéâ**
